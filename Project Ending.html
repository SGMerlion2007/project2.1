            <h2>Why the A380 Ended in Failure</h2>
            <p>
                The first A380 was delivered to Singapore Airlines on the 15th of October 2007 and entered service 
                25th October 2007. The final total of A380s delivered and produced come to a whopping 251 aircraft, 
                with 244 in service as of now. Emirates has adopted the A380 as their flagship, and operates the most 
                A380s of any airline, with 123 A380s in their fleet. However, after multiple setbacks, the pandemic, 
                and loss of interest, Airbus had to end the A380's production.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another reason why the A380 program ended was because Airbus had predicted commercial aviation with less frequency, but more capacity. 
                Subsequently, airlines opted for more frequency and slightly smaller capacity, as it was more economically
                viable and cheaper. And as a result, Airbus had lost too much money to continue the program. 
                The final A380 fuselage was completed in September 2020, and on the 17th of March 2021, it was flown from 
                Toulouse, France, to Hamburg, Germany, for cabin fitting. It was then handed over to Emirates on the 
                16th of December 2021, as the final A380 to be ever built. The first A380 from Singapore Airlines is now 
                scrapped and not in service. It is the world's biggest commercial airliner to date, with the 
                project being unsuccessful and unprofitable.
