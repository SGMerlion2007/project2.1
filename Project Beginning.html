        <h2>The Beginning of the Jumbo Jet</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>A380</strong> was conceived when Boeing had been dominating the <strong>ultra-high-capacity airliner
            (UHCA)</strong> market with its 747. There were several key factors that prompted Airbus to enter the UHCA market. Firstly, Airbus needed a
            jumbo to complete their own range of aircraft. Another reason why the A380 was conceived was because they wanted
            to break the dominance Boeing had in the jumbo jet industry. In addition, there were many other Boeing
            competitors who tried to break the UHCA market. For example, companies such as <em>Lockheed</em> and <em>McDonnell
            Douglas</em> had attempted to rival the 747, but the projects either failed or were still being deliberated, which gave Airbus the perfect
            time to strike.

            The A380 was initially announced in June 1994 under the name <strong>A3XX</strong>. However, on the 19th of December 2000, the
            board of Airbus voted to launch a €9.5 billion ($10.7 billion) project to build the A3XX, which was to be
        re-designated as <em>A380</em>. Subsequently, the aircraft configuration was finished in 2001, and manufacturing of the
            first A380 component began in January 2002. By the time the first A380 was delivered, the development cost had 
            grown to €11 to 14 <strong>billion</strong>.
